                            The second largest city in Russia, St. Petersburg is rightfully called the cultural capital of Russia.
                            A metropolitan city of five million people, it every year attracts nearly seven million tourists, 
                            of which about one half are foreign guests coming from all over the world. St. Petersburg was founded 
                            by the first Emperor of Russia, Tsar Peter the Great in 1703 as the new, western-style capital of Russia. 
                            Since its first days, St. Petersburg had always been a multicultural city, welcoming guests and 
                            specialists from other countries. Along with Russian masters and architects, many European builders 
                            and engineers contributed to the glory and beauty of the city.
                            One of the world's most beautiful cities, St. Petersburg has all the ingredients for an unforgettable travel 
                            experience: high art, lavish architecture, wild nightlife, an extraordinary history and rich cultural traditions 
                            that have inspired and nurtured some of the modern world's greatest literature, music, and visual art. From the 
                            mysterious twilight of the White Nights to world-beating opera and ballet productions on magical winter evenings,
                            St. Petersburg charms and entices in every season. Saint-Petersburg.Com is here to help you navigate every aspect

                            just like Venice. Known for having extravagant palaces, museums, and theatres, it can be tiring to see and discover all

                    <p class="city-text">Moscow, Russian Moskva, city, capital of Russia, located in the far western part of the country. 
                        Since it was first mentioned in the chronicles of 1147, Moscow has played a vital role in Russian history.
                        It became the capital of Muscovy (the Grand Principality of Moscow) in the late 13th century; hence,
                        the people of Moscow are known as Muscovites. Today Moscow is not only the political centre of Russia 
                        but also the country’s most populous city and its industrial, cultural, scientific, and educational 
                        capital. There's always something going on in Moscow: exhibitions, festivals, performances, excursions, 
                        concerts, quests, marathons... You can have a great time in Moscow and you don't have to spend a fortune 
                        either: get a bird's-eye view of the city, take a boat ride down Moscow river, descend 65 metres below 
                        ground to the Cold War bunker, take drawing or guitar classes, take a tour around Moscow's bars or take 
                        part in wine tasting, enjoy roller skating in a park, or visit a maze of mirrors... 
                        Moscow offers a great variety of restaurants and cafes. A French croisserie neighbours a Tyrolean cafe 
                        and restaurant serving 30 sorts of beer, while a Chinese snack bar competes with a Vietnamese noodle bar. 
                        Naturally, you will find many places here offering Russian cuisine. Students can enjoy affordable cafes,
                        groceries, and food delivery services. Moscow is famous for its fabulous night life. The number of night clubs,
                        discos, and entertainment centres here is almost infinite. You can also take a night city tour (on foot or by bus) 
                        and participate in a stage show in one of its museums. The city hosts the Night of Museums event on an annual basis, 
                        when the leading art facilities, concerts, performances, stage shows, and master classes are available to visitors for free.
                        Social scientists state, that only 2% of Moscow's population of more than 12 mln people, are indigenous residents. Over the
                         last 20 years, three million people migrated to Moscow from other regions of Russia, and the number of 
                        foreigners (excluding the CIS countries) who live here on a permanent basis is estimated to top 300,000 
                        people. People from different countries and religions find life very comfortable in Moscow, with its 
                        Orthodox churches, synagogues, mosques, Catholic churches, Buddhist centres, and more. No wonder the 
                        British newspaper The Independent called this cosmopolitan city the most foreigner-friendly.
