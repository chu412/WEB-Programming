                <h2 id="Hanoi"> Ha Noi </h2>
                <p> Ha Noi is the capital city of Vietnam in the north of Vietnam. Founded over 1000 years ago, Vietnam‚Äôs capital city is rich in history, 
                    with the streets of its rambling Old Quarter dating back to the 14th century. 
                    Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. 
                    However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated 
                    with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you 
                    have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia h∆°i.</p>

                <h2 id="Saint">Saint Petersburg</h2>
                <p>
                    The second largest city in Russia, St. Petersburg is rightfully called the cultural capital of Russia.
                     A metropolitan city of five million people, it every year attracts nearly seven million tourists, 
                     of which about one half are foreign guests coming from all over the world. St. Petersburg was founded 
                     by the first Emperor of Russia, Tsar Peter the Great in 1703 as the new, western-style capital of Russia. 
                     Since its first days, St. Petersburg had always been a multicultural city, welcoming guests and 
                     specialists from other countries. Along with Russian masters and architects, many European builders 
                     and engineers contributed to the glory and beauty of the city.

                <h2 id="Moscow">Moscow</h2>
                <p>Moscow, Russian Moskva, city, capital of Russia, located in the far western part of the country. 
                    Since it was first mentioned in the chronicles of 1147, Moscow has played a vital role in Russian history.
                    It became the capital of Muscovy (the Grand Principality of Moscow) in the late 13th century; hence,
                    the people of Moscow are known as Muscovites. Today Moscow is not only the political centre of Russia 
                    but also the country‚Äôs most populous city and its industrial, cultural, scientific, and educational 
                    capital.</p>
